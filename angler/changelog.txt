0b85688 hwc: Trigger dynamic refresh-rate change for more usecases * Until now it's been the case that refresh-rates were set to the standard values of 24, 30, 48 and 60 for video playback usecases. Since of the most panel vendors can only support refresh-rates above 45, in many of the use-cases with fps < 45, dynamic change in panel refresh rate doesn't happen.
